Requirements:
Download Dolphin Emulator: https://dolphin-emu.org/download/
Obtain an unmodified GM5E7D Metal Arms: Glitch in the System .iso file (Do NOT ask anyone to give you one)
If you need help or have questions, join the Metal Arms Modding Discord server:
https://discord.gg/3Dztwe6Wcy


Instructions:
1. Place your mod .zip file in the mods folder (Must be a .zip file containing an .mst. Multiple mods can be installed at once, but some might be conflicting)
2. Drag-and-drop the unmodified .iso over exavolt.exe
3. After a moment, mod.iso will be created with your mods installed
4. Open mod.iso in Dolphin and play!


IF THE GAME FREEZES:
When you load an existing save file for the first time after modding the game, expect there to be a 10-20 second delay. The game will appear frozen as the save file is modified to support new features added by Exavolt, but it should resume after.


FIRST TIME USAGE:
Exavolt.exe will automatically extend the game's memory, but an extra step is required (you only have to do this once)
1. in Dolphin, open Config and go to Advanced tab
2. Check Enable MMU
3. Under Memory Override, Check Enable Emulated Memory Size Override
4. Slide the MEM1 and MEM2 sliders all the way to the right
Done!
